I have a background in Business with some experience in coding, and Iâ€™m now transitioning into the cybersecurity field. My focus is on identifying and analyzing risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to help businesses strengthen their security posture. I'm passionate about protecting critical assets and contributing to national security in an increasingly digital world.

# What I'm Working On

- Gaining hands-on experience with security tools and best practices
- Pursuing certifications to deepen my expertise

## Objective

My journey in technology has sparked a strong passion for cybersecurity, and I am now focused on transitioning into this field to become a Cybersecurity Engineer. I am particularly interested in securing networks, detecting threats, and implementing defense strategies. As a first step, I aim to gain hands-on experience in a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst to build a strong foundation in threat monitoring and incident response.
